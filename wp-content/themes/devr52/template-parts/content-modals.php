                        <p>This is my first static website, the concept of payroll is based on my previous java swing project. It's design inspiration comes from the website of PayrollHero. </p>

                        <h4>Objectives</h4>
                        <p>Create a static website of your choice. With at least 5 pages and a sign-in and sign-up page.</p>

                        <h4>Challenges</h4>
                        <p>Short timeframe. Responsiveness (Though I think it's too soon to think about it but it's just me being me.)</p>

                        <h4>Results</h4>
                        <p>I've already have some basic HTML & CSS background before but I've never considered the exercises I have done before as a real website. So I'm quite happy to be able to build this one as my debut website.</p>

                        <p>A website created for demonstration of basic SQL CRUD operations. Obviously its design inspiration comes from the website of Pizza Hut.</p>

                        <h4>Objectives</h4>
                        <p>To create a restaurant website or any type of website with an admin panel that can demonstrate data creation,retrieval,update,delete which is the basics of SQL. Non-registered users can't access or view the page if they're not logged in as a user/admin. Create a dropdown menu that filters products/items by category.</p>

                        <h4>Challenges</h4>
                        <p>I've worked before with basic SQL queries that's why I can say it's more of review than a challenge for me. Aside from that I think copying the design of Pizza Hut Website is pretty challenging though responsiveness is still my main problem.</p>

                        <p>Lost Ark Forum is an online game forum where players discuss news and announcements about the game, gameplays, guides and other game related activities. The design inspiration of this website comes from the forum of Revelation Online which is another game LOL. </p>

                        <h4>Objectives</h4>
                        <p>To create a forum website with its fundamental functionalities. Learn SQL Relationships during the process.</p>

                        <h4>Challenges</h4>
                        <p>One of the most notable challenges I've encountered with this project was the implementation of the WYSIWYG Editor, another one is having a good code structure, I remember having a hard time implementing <i>breadcrumbs</i> because of a bad code structure.</p>
                        <i style="font-size: 12px;"><br>('Breadcrumbs - is a type of secondary navigation scheme that reveals the user's location in a website or Web application')</i>
                        <h4>Results</h4>
                        <p>By far this one is my favorite probably because I just like MMORPG? Just kidding! actually I liked it because I really spent a lot of effort and time designing it and making it responsive. On the back-end side, I'm not really satisfied because somehow I don't know that there is a thing called "SQL JOINS" which makes things a lot easier when you're dealing with SQL Relationships(which later on I found out that I sucked at it, luckily Laravel came!!). Of course it's not perfect, but overall I like how I manage to build this forum and being able to add at least the MUST have functionalities of a forum website.
                           <br>
                           <br>P.S. Not all you see is functional also beware of the sign-up page you can get away even you didn't match the confirm password field with the password you typed. :P</p>

                        <p>EZ-Payroll is a online payroll system designed for basic payroll computations. Features includes mass insertion/update of employee records, easy payslip generation and many more.</p>

                        <h4>Objectives</h4>
                        <p>To learn Laravel Framework and create a website using Laravel in which you need to apply all the things you've learned with all the previous projects given a time period of three weeks.</p>

                        <h4>Challenges</h4>
                        <p>Laravel was introduced to us two weeks before the deadline, meaning we already have written some of our codes during the first week. The challenge? First, I need to convert my codes from normal PHP to something that will utilize Laravel. Second, I need to learn Laravel two-weeks before the deadline which is not easy but worth it :D.
                           <br>
                           <br> P.S. I haven't figured out yet how to do mail:queues in a production setting. Somebody help me.</p>

                        <h4>Results</h4>
                        <p>After three stressful weeks, I somehow manage to at least finish a one way trip to payslip generation. What does it mean? It means that everything will work fine as long as you use the website correctly or at least you're able to learn it correctly<i>(Sorry there's no written documentation yet on how to use it)</i>. I admit that this payroll website have more loopholes than any of my previous projects. But overall I'm pretty happy with the result of this project, I learned so much and that's what important. I even learned basic bootstrap along the way and I feel like I don't want to do hard coded css again.</p>
